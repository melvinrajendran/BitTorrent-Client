This repository contains the source code for a full-featured BitTorrent client, built using Go. BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol designed to facilitate file transfers among multiple peers across unreliable networks. This client takes full advantage of Go's concurrency features, which include goroutines and channels, to download and upload files.

## Getting Started

To run the client, first clone the repository.

git clone ...

Next, run the client
